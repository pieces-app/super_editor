## [0.3.0-dev.1]
### June 10, 2024
MAJOR UPDATE: First taste of the new editor pipeline. 

This is a dev release so that you can begin to see the changes coming in the next major version. 
This release comes with numerous and significant breaking changes. As we get closer to stability 
for the next release, we'll add website guides to help update all of our users. 

The primary features that we've been working on since last release include:
 * Undo/Redo
 * A stable edit pipeline: requests > commands > change list > reactions > listeners
 * Common reaction features, e.g., hash tags and user tagging

In addition to the major feature work, we've made hundreds of little adjustments, including bugfixes.

We expect a steady stream of dev releases from this point forward, until we reach `v0.3.0`.
